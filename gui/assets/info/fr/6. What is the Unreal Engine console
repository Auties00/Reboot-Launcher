Many Fortnite versions don't support entering in game by clicking the \"Play\" button.
Instead, you need to click the key assigned to the Unreal Engine console, by default F8 or the tilde(the button above tab), and type open 127.0.0.1
Keep in mind that the Unreal Engine console key is controlled by the backend, so this is true only if you are using the embedded backend: custom backends might use different keys.
When using the embedded backend, you can customize the key used to open the console in the \"Backend\" tab of the Reboot Launcher.
