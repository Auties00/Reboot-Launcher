For others to join your game server, port 7777 must be accessible on your PC.
One option is to use a private VPN service like Hamachi or Radmin, but all of the players will need to download this software.
The best solution is to use port forwarding:
1. Set a static IP
    If you don't have already a static IP set, set one by following any tutorial on Google
2. Log into your router's admin panel
    Usually this can be accessed on any web browser by going to http://192.168.1.1/
    You might need a username and a password to log in: refer to your router's manual for precise instructions
3. Find the port forwarding section
    Once logged in into the admin panel, navigate to the port forwarding section of your router's settings
    This location may vary from router to router, but it's typically labelled as "Port Forwarding," "Port Mapping" or "Virtual Server"
    Refer to your router's manual for precise instructions
4. Add a port forwarding rule
    Now, you'll need to create a new port forwarding rule. Here's what you'll typically need to specify:
    - Service Name: Choose a name for your port forwarding rule (e.g., "Fortnite Game Server")
    - Port Number: Enter 7777 for both the external and internal ports
    - Protocol: Select the UDP protocol
    - Internal IP Address: Enter the static IP address you set earlier
    - Enable: Make sure the port forwarding rule is enabled
5. Save and apply the changes
    After configuring the port forwarding rule, save your changes and apply them
    This step may involve clicking a "Save" or "Apply" button on your router's web interface
