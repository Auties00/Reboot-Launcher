As explained in the "What is the Unreal Engine console?" section, the "Play" button doesn't work in many Fortnite versions.
Instead, you need to click the key assigned to the Unreal Engine console, by default F8 or the tilde(the button above tab), and type open 127.0.0.1
If that doesn't work, go to the Host page and make sure that you are running a game server by clicking "Start Hosting".
